MONSTR.sh --t1 T1_IMAGE --t2 T2_IMAGE --fl FLAIR_IMAGE --pd PD_IMAGE --swi SWI_IMAGE 
     --o OutputDir --atlasdir AtlasDir --natlas NumAtlas --rad SearchRadius --clean --reg --robust --ncpu NumCPU --fast

Required arguments:

T1_IMAGE      T1-w image with skull

T2_IMAGE      T2-w image with skull, need not be registered to the T1. (optional)

FL_IMAGE      FLAIR image with skull, need not be registered to the T1.  (optional)

PD_IMAGE      PD-w image with skull, need not be registered to the T1.  (optional)

SWI_IMAGE     SWI image with skull, need not be registered to the T1.  (optional)

              This also works as a single channel stripping script, i.e. at least one of
              the T1, T2, PD, FL, SWI are required.
              ** If T1 is present, first channel must be T1.
              ** If T1 is not mentioned, then the first mentioned channel is used
              ** to register atlases, and then transformation is used for next channels.

OutputDir     Output directory where the result mask will be written.

AtlasDir      Atlas directory, where atlasX_T1.nii,atlasX_T2.nii, atlasX_PD.nii, atlas_SWI.nii, 
              atlasX_FL.nii, atlasX_brainmask.nii files are kept. X = 1,2,3. 
              Not all modalities are required, but they should correspond with the modalities 
              of the subject images. The naming convention (i.e. atlasX_YY.nii, X=1,2,3 
              YY=T1,T2,PD,FL,SWI) must be strictly followed.

NumAtlas      Number of atlases to be used. Usually 4 works well. The atlas directory must 
              contain these number of atlases. Default is 4.

SearchRadius  Search radius for atlas patches, usually 5-9 works well. Default is 5.

Optional Arguments:

--clean       Cleaning temporary files. If this argument is mentioned, the temporary files 
              will be deleted. If not mentioned, temporary files will be retained (default). 
              Temporary files are kept in a separate directory inside OutputDir

--reg         Use this flag if the T2/PD/FLAIR images are already registered to the 
              T1. If not mentioned, then the T2/PD/FLAIR images WILL be registered to the T1. 
              ** This option works if and only if T1 image is provided. Otherwise, all input 
              ** modalities must be co-registered, and don't use this option.

--robust      Atlases are registered to the subject using a more robust approach. a), necks 
              from the subject and atlases are removed, b) the background noises are removed 
              from the images, c) then the atlas is registered to the subjet. It takes more 
              time, and usually not necessary. In future, this will be default.

--ncpu        Number of processors to be used for parallel processing. Recommended is at least 8. 
              If not mentioned, all availabe processors will be used.

--fast        If --fast option is mentioned, images will be subsampled. The brainmask will be generated 
              on a low resolution image, and upsampled to the original resolution. 
              Default is off, i.e. brainmask will be created on original images.

All files must be NIFTI(.nii). nii.gz files are not acceptable. 
The output is the brainmask in the orientation of the T1 image.

This script requires AFNI, FSL, ANTs to be installed and added to PATH environment variables.
