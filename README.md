# Brain_MR_Image_Preprocessing
Preprocessing pipeline of Brain MR Image for medical research. \
*For installation of preprocessing tools and code usage, check out reference.md.*

## Overview

## Tools
### 1)ANTs(Advanced Normalization Tools) 
- A tool for biomedical image analysis with a focus on registration, segmentation, etc. 
- Used for Resampling, N4 Bias Correction, Co-registration. 

### MONSTR(Multi-cONtrast brain STRipping method ) 
- A software tool to generate brain masks (or skull-strip) from multi-contrast MR brain images, such as T1, T2, PD, or FLAIR. 
- Compared to other tools that are validated on T1-based skull stripping methods, MONSTR involves multi-modal inputs(supports T1, T2, FLAIR)ì™€ multi-model atlases.
- Used for Skull Stripping.


## Step
### 1) Resampling
- Resize voxel to 1X1X1.
- Output

### 2) N4 Bias Correction
- Method for correcting low frequency intensity non-uniformity present in MRI image data known as a bias or gain field.
- Output

### 3) Co-Registration (to T1C)
- Brings one image(mostly T1C) to match another image, such that the same voxels refers roughly to the same structure in both brains.
- Output

### 4) Skull-Stripping + Apply skull mask
- Generate skull mask for each brain image, and strip.
- Output
